# OctoPrint-LUI

Lily User Interface
----

**Note** Works only with current development versions of OctoPrint (1.3.0-dev)
since it necessitates a plugin type not available in the current stable
versions. This is heavy work in progress. 

----

Enables a mobile first responsive UI, build on modern browser capabilities of Flexbox. 

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Plugin-Manager)
