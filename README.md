# OctoPrint-LUI

Leapfrog User Interface
----

**Note** Works only with current development versions of OctoPrint (1.3.0-dev)
since it necessitates a plugin type not available in the current stable
versions. This is heavy work in progress. This plugin is geared towards usage on machines 
of Leapfrog 3D Printers. 

----

Enables a mobile first responsive UI, build on modern browser capabilities of Flexbox. 

## Setup

This UI plugin needs several other plugins to function:

OctoPrint-NetworkManager
OctoPrint-flashArduino
OctoPrint-gcodeRender
